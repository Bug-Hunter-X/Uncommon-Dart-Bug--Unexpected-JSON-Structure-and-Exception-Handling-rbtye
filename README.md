# Uncommon Dart Bug: Unexpected JSON Structure and Exception Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Dart when handling asynchronous operations and JSON responses. The code attempts to fetch data from an API, parse the JSON response, and extract specific data points.  However, it lacks robust error handling for cases where the JSON structure is unexpected or the API request fails.

The `bug.dart` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution with improved error handling and type safety.
